Me and my coding buddy Tihomir are making Real Estate Application. The idea behind this application is to make application where users and brokers can meet. Under brokers I mean every person who wants to sell some home or land. We want to train our coding skills. Here we are writing the front end of the application. We are using React.

You can start the project on local with few easy steps:

you have to clone the repository
you have to write on the terminal "npm install" (you need to have Node installed on your system)
here you have 2 options: 
 - you can use hosted back end on the url provided in urls.js
 - you can clone the back end repository from https://github.com/DamyanBG/real-estate-nodejs-be 
you have to write "npm start"

And do not forget to enjoy !
