# Real Estate

The idea behind this application is to create a place where buyers and sellers can meet. In this
application the user can register an account, search for a real estate listing base of his/her
preference(s) and make an inquiry of the listing; and the admin can manage resources including
property listings, realtors and contact inquiries in the admin area. Here we are creating the front
end of the application that you can see live
[here](https://zealous-beach-0787b0d03.2.azurestaticapps.net//). You can find the backend repository
[here.](https://github.com/DamyanBG/real-estate-nodejs-be)
