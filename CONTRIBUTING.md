# IMPORTANT ! ! ! I NEED HELP AND FOR THE BACK END OF THIS REACT APP, CONSIDER CONTRIBUTING ON https://github.com/DamyanBG/real-estate-nodejs-be/

First I want say welcome to our project and thank you for your time !

This is a small project. For that we have very simple workflow for now - if you like some
task/issue, write a comment that you want to be assigned. Some of the team members will assign the
task for you. After that you can fork the repository and when you are ready, make a PR to the main
branch. Further we will make another branch for merging the new code.

It is a open project and there is no rush and hurry. Take your time when you are doing some task.
Some ETA or some updates in the comment section of the issue will be very appreciated too.

# IMPORTANT ! IF YOU FIND ANY ISSUES ON THE DEPLOYED BACK END, CREATE AN ISSUE ON https://github.com/DamyanBG/real-estate-nodejs-be/issues
